I'm trying to learn Rust so I thought it would be a good idea to build a fullstack, Rust-only app.

The idea is to use Yew for front-end, Actix for back-end server and Diesel as ORM. I'm learning Rust syntax and features on the way.

I'm not sure what I'm building yet but probably a Twitter clone or smth like that.
